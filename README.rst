AdaConv
==============================

Unofficial PyTorch implementation of the Adaptive Convolution architecture for image style transfer from `"Adaptive Convolutions for Structure-Aware Style Transfer" <https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Chandran_Adaptive_Convolutions_for_Structure-Aware_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf>`__.
Disclaimer: I have not trained the model the full number of iterations yet.
